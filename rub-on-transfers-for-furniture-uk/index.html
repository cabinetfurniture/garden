<p><strong>2. Prepare the surface properly.</strong><br />Before applying a rub-on transfer, it's important to clean and prepare the surface of your furniture. This will help the transfer to adhere properly and prevent it from peeling or fading.</p>
<p><strong>3. Use a light touch.</strong><br />When rubbing the transfer onto the surface, use a light touch. Rubbing too hard can cause the transfer to tear or smudge.</p>
<p><strong>4. Protect the transfer.</strong><br />Once the transfer has been applied, you can protect it by applying a clear sealant or varnish. This will help to protect the transfer from fading and wear.</p>
<p>By following these tips, you can ensure that your rub-on transfers will look their best and last for many years to come.</p>
