These sets typically include a crib and a dresser or changing table, two essential pieces of furniture that will serve you well for years to come. When choosing a set, it is important to consider both the style and the function of the pieces.</p>

<p>The function of the set is also important to consider. Make sure that the crib is the right size for your baby and that it has all of the safety features that you want. The dresser or changing table should have enough drawers or shelves to store all of your baby's clothes and other belongings. It should also be at a comfortable height for you to use.</p>
