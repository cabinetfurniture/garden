Before you start shopping, take some time to think about how you plan to use your garden furniture. Will it be primarily for dining, lounging, or entertaining?

Garden furniture is exposed to the elements, so it's important to choose pieces that are made from durable and weather-resistant materials.

You want your garden furniture to be comfortable to sit in, especially if you plan on spending long hours relaxing or entertaining outdoors. Look for furniture with cushions or padding, and make sure the seating is supportive and ergonomic. You may also want to consider adding throws and blankets for extra comfort on cooler evenings.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Maintain your garden furniture regularly:</strong><br />
To keep your garden furniture looking its best and lasting for many years, it's important to maintain it regularly. Clean the furniture with a mild detergent and water, and apply a sealant or stain to wooden furniture to protect it from the elements. For metal furniture, use a rust-resistant coating to prevent rust. Store your furniture in a dry, sheltered place during the off-season to protect it from harsh weather conditions.</p>
