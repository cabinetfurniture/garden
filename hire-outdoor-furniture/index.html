<p>When choosing the right pieces of outdoor furniture to hire, there are a few things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Size and shape:</strong> Consider the size and shape of your outdoor space. You'll want to choose pieces that are the right size for your space and that will allow your guests to move around comfortably.
</li><li><strong>Style:</strong> Choose pieces that match the style of your event. If you're having a casual party, you might want to choose more relaxed pieces. If you're having a more formal event, you might want to choose more elegant pieces.
</li><li><strong>Comfort:</strong> Make sure the pieces you choose are comfortable for your guests. You don't want your guests to be uncomfortable or in pain after sitting in your furniture for a few hours.
</li><li><strong>Durability:</strong> Choose pieces that are durable and can withstand the elements. If you're having your event outdoors, you'll want to choose pieces that are made from weather-resistant materials.
</li></ul>
<p>Once you've considered all of these factors, you can start to narrow down your choices. You can browse online rental catalogs or visit a local rental store to see what's available. Be sure to ask the rental company about the different pieces they have available and their recommendations for your event.</p>
<h3>Consider your budget</h3>
<p>When it comes to hiring outdoor furniture, it's important to consider your budget. Outdoor furniture rental prices can vary depending on the type of furniture, the quantity of furniture, and the length of the rental period. Here are a few tips for staying within your budget:</p>
<ul>

</li><li><strong>Compare prices from different rental companies:</strong> Be sure to get quotes from multiple companies before making a decision.
</li><li><strong>Consider renting used furniture:</strong> Used furniture is often available at a lower cost than new furniture.
</li><li><strong>Negotiate with the rental company:</strong> You may be able to get a discount if you rent furniture for a longer period of time or if you rent multiple pieces.
</li></ul>
<p>Once you've considered all of these factors, you can start to narrow down your choices and find the best deal on outdoor furniture rental.</p>
<h3>Factor in delivery and setup</h3>

Setup fees can also vary, depending on the complexity of the setup. Here are a few tips for saving money on delivery and setup:</p>
<p><strong>Ask about free delivery:</strong> Some rental companies offer free delivery for orders over a certain amount. Be sure to ask about this when you're getting quotes from different companies.</p>
<p><strong>Choose a rental company that's close to your event location:</strong> This will help to reduce the cost of delivery. You can also ask the rental company if they offer any discounts for local deliveries.</p>
<p><strong>Set up the furniture yourself:</strong> If you're handy, you can save money by setting up the furniture yourself. Be sure to ask the rental company for instructions on how to set up the furniture properly.</p>
<p><strong>Get help from friends or family:</strong> If you don't want to set up the furniture yourself, you can ask friends or family to help you. This is a great way to save money and get the furniture set up quickly and easily.</p>
<p>By following these tips, you can save money on delivery and setup when hiring outdoor furniture.</p>
<h3>Read the rental agreement</h3>
<p>Before you sign the rental agreement, it's important to read it carefully and make sure you understand all of the terms and conditions. The rental agreement should include information about the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The type and quantity of furniture you're renting:</strong> Make sure the agreement lists all of the pieces of furniture you're renting, as well as the quantity of each piece.
</li><li><strong>The rental period:</strong> The agreement should specify the start and end dates of your rental period.
</li><li><strong>The delivery and setup fees:</strong> The agreement should include the cost of delivery and setup, as well as any additional fees that may apply.
</li><li><strong>The damage deposit:</strong> The agreement may require you to pay a damage deposit. This deposit will be refunded to you at the end of your rental period, provided that the furniture is returned in good condition.
