<p>Bedroom furniture can be heavy and bulky, so it is helpful to shop with a friend who can help you carry your purchases. This is especially important if you are buying multiple items or if you have a long walk from the store to your car.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Shopping with a friend to help you carry purchases is a great way to make your Black Friday shopping experience easier and more enjoyable.</p>
