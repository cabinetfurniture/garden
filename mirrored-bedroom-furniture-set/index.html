<p><strong><em>Question 1: What is the best material for garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
Answer 1: The best material for garden furniture depends on your individual needs and preferences. Some popular materials include teak, acacia, and aluminum.

Aluminum is a lightweight and rust-resistant material that is easy to care for.</p>
<p><strong><em>Question 2: How do I choose the right size garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
Answer 2: When choosing the right size garden furniture, it is important to consider the size of your outdoor space and the number of people you typically entertain.

<p><strong><em>Question 6: Can I leave my garden furniture outside all year round?</em></strong><br />
Answer 6: Whether or not you can leave your garden furniture outside all year round depends on the material of the furniture and the climate in which you live.
