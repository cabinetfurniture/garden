<ul>
    <li><strong>Made from high-quality materials</strong><br /><p>Regatta garden furniture is made from high-quality materials, such as teak, aluminum, and wicker. These materials are known for their durability and resistance to weathering. Teak is a particularly good choice for outdoor furniture, as it is naturally resistant to rot and decay.</p></li>

    <li><strong>Easy to care for</strong><br /><p>Regatta garden furniture is easy to care for. Simply wipe it down with a damp cloth to remove dirt and debris.</p></li>
