<p>So what are you waiting for? Start shopping today and save big on your new garden furniture!</p>
<h3>Find the best deals at end-of-season sales</h3>
<p>One of the best times to find the best deals on garden furniture is at the end of the season. As stores start to clear out their inventory to make way for new stock, they often offer deep end-of-season sales on garden furniture.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Huge savings:</strong> You can often find garden furniture at up to 70% off or more during end-of-season sales.</li>
  <li><strong>Wide selection:</strong> End-of-season sales typically feature a wide selection of garden furniture styles, so you're sure to find something that suits your taste and needs.</li>
  <li><strong>Limited time offer:</strong> End-of-season sales are usually only for a limited time, so it's important to shop early to get the best deals.</li>
  <li><strong>Be prepared for limited stock:</strong> Since end-of-season sales are typically clearance sales, there may be limited stock available. If you see something you like, don't wait to buy it or it may be gone when you come back.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're patient enough to wait until the end of the season, you can find some amazing deals on garden furniture. However, it's important to keep in mind that selection may be limited, so it's best to shop early to get the best selection and prices.</p>
<h3>Shop online or in-store for the best selection</h3>
<p>When it comes to shopping for garden furniture on sale, you have two main options: online and in-store. Both options have their own advantages and disadvantages, so it's important to choose the one that's best for you.</p>
<p><strong>Shopping online:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Convenience:</strong> Online shopping is incredibly convenient. You can shop from the comfort of your own home, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</li>
  <li><strong>Wide selection:</strong> Online retailers often have a wider selection of garden furniture than brick-and-mortar stores. This is because they don't have the same space constraints as physical stores.</li>
  <li><strong>Price comparison:</strong> It's easy to compare prices from different retailers online. This can help you find the best deal on the garden furniture you want.</li>
  <li><strong>Shipping costs:</strong> Shipping costs can be a downside to shopping online. However, many retailers offer free shipping on orders over a certain amount.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Shopping in-store:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>See the furniture in person:</strong> When you shop in-store, you can see the garden furniture in person before you buy it. This allows you to check the quality of the construction and materials, and to make sure that the furniture is the right size and style for your needs.</li>
  <li><strong>Get expert advice:</strong> In-store sales associates can provide you with expert advice on choosing the right garden furniture for your needs. They can also help you find the best deals on the furniture you want.</li>
  <li><strong>Take the furniture home with you:</strong> When you shop in-store, you can take the furniture home with you right away. This is especially convenient if you need the furniture for an upcoming event.</li>
  <li><strong>Limited selection:</strong> Brick-and-mortar stores typically have a more limited selection of garden furniture than online retailers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, the best way to shop for garden furniture on sale is the way that's most convenient and comfortable for you. If you prefer the convenience of shopping online, then go for it. But if you prefer to see the furniture in person before you buy it, then shopping in-store is a better option.</p>
<h3>Look for sales on clearance items</h3>
<p>One of the best ways to save even more money on garden furniture during an out and out sale is to look for sales on clearance items. Clearance items are items that are being sold at a deep discount because they are discontinued, slightly damaged, or have other minor issues.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Huge savings:</strong> Clearance items are often discounted by 50% or more off the original price.</li>
  <li><strong>Wide selection:</strong> Many retailers offer a wide selection of clearance items, so you're sure to find something that suits your taste and needs.</li>
  <li><strong>Limited quantities:</strong> Clearance items are usually available in limited quantities, so it's important to shop early to get the best selection.</li>
  <li><strong>Inspect the items carefully:</strong> Before you buy a clearance item, inspect it carefully for any damage or defects. Make sure that the item is still in good condition and that you're happy with it before you purchase it.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're willing to do a little digging, you can find some amazing deals on clearance garden furniture. Just be sure to inspect the items carefully before you buy them to make sure that they're in good condition.</p>
<h3>Compare prices before you buy</h3>
<p>Before you buy any garden furniture on sale, it's important to compare prices from different retailers. This will help you make sure that you're getting the best deal possible.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Online price comparison:</strong> There are a number of online tools that allow you to compare prices from different retailers. This is a quick and easy way to find the best price on the garden furniture you want.</li>
  <li><strong>In-store price comparison:</strong> If you're shopping in-store, you can compare prices by visiting different stores. Be sure to check both big box stores and smaller, specialty stores. You may be able to find the same item for a lower price at a smaller store.</li>
  <li><strong>Consider the total cost:</strong> When comparing prices, be sure to consider the total cost of the garden furniture, including shipping and assembly costs. Sometimes, a retailer may offer a lower price on the furniture itself, but charge higher shipping or assembly fees.</li>
  <li><strong>Check for coupons and promo codes:</strong> Many retailers offer coupons and promo codes that can save you even more money on your purchase. Be sure to check for these coupons and promo codes before you buy.</li>
</ul>
<p>By comparing prices before you buy, you can make sure that you're getting the best deal possible on your new garden furniture.</p>
<h3>Read reviews to see what other customers have to say</h3>
<p>Before you buy any garden furniture on sale, it's a good idea to read reviews from other customers. This can give you valuable insights into the quality of the furniture, the customer service of the retailer, and the overall shopping experience.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Find reviews online:</strong> There are a number of websites where you can find reviews of garden furniture. Some popular websites include Amazon, Wayfair, and Houzz. You can also find reviews on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram.</li>
  <li><strong>Read both positive and negative reviews:</strong> It's important to read both positive and negative reviews to get a well-rounded view of the product. Pay attention to the common complaints and see if they're dealbreakers for you.</li>
  <li><strong>Look for reviews with photos:</strong> Reviews with photos can be especially helpful, as they allow you to see the furniture in real-life settings. This can help you get a better idea of how the furniture will look in your own backyard or patio.</li>
  <li><strong>Consider the source of the reviews:</strong> When reading reviews, it's important to consider the source. Make sure that the reviews are from verified customers who have actually purchased the product.</li>
</ul>
<p>By reading reviews, you can get a better idea of the quality of the garden furniture and the customer service of the retailer. This can help you make an informed decision about whether or not to purchase the furniture.</p>
<h3>Don't miss out on the best deals - shop early!</h3>
<p>Out and out garden furniture sales typically last for a limited time, so it's important to shop early to get the best deals. The best deals are usually available at the beginning of the sale, so if you wait too long, you may miss out on the best selection and prices.</p>
