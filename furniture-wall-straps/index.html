            <p>Furniture wall straps are an essential safety measure for any home with children, pets, or unstable furniture. These straps provide a secure connection between furniture and the wall, preventing it from tipping over and causing injury or damage.</p>
<p>In recent years, there have been several high-profile cases of furniture-related accidents, including fatalities. In 2016, for example, a two-year-old boy was killed when a dresser fell on him.

Furniture wall straps prevent furniture from tipping over by securing it to the wall. This is especially important for furniture that is used by children or pets, or that is placed in areas where it is likely to be bumped or pushed.
<h4>Here are four ways that furniture wall straps can prevent furniture from tipping over:</h4>
