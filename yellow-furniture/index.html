If you have a traditional home, choose classic pieces of furniture with clean lines. If you have a modern home, choose more contemporary pieces of furniture with unique shapes and colors. You can also mix and match different styles to create a unique look.</p>
<p><strong>4. Accessorize with cushions, pillows, and throws.</strong> You can add personality to your garden furniture with cushions, pillows, and throws.
