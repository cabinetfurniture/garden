<li><strong>Moisture content</strong><br /><p>The moisture content of the wood is also important. Furniture made from wood with a low moisture content is less likely to warp than furniture made from wood with a high moisture content.</p></li>
<li><strong>Finish</strong><br /><p>The finish of the furniture can also help to prevent warping. A good finish will seal the wood and protect it from moisture.</p></li>
