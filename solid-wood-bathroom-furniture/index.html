<p>To protect the finish of your solid wood furniture, you should also apply a furniture polish or wax on a regular basis. This will help to keep the wood looking its best and prevent it from drying out.</p>

<h3>Resistant to warping</h3>

<li><strong>Moisture content</strong><br /><p>The moisture content of the wood is also important. Furniture made from wood with a low moisture content is less likely to warp than furniture made from wood with a high moisture content.</p></li>
<li><strong>Finish</strong><br /><p>The finish of the furniture can also help to prevent warping. A good finish will seal the wood and protect it from moisture.</p></li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Finish</strong><br /><p>The finish of the furniture can also help to protect it from fading. A good finish will seal the wood and protect it from UV radiation.</p></li>
<li><strong>Location</strong><br /><p>The location of the furniture can also affect its resistance to fading. Furniture that is placed in direct sunlight is more likely to fade than furniture that is placed in a shaded area.</p></li>
