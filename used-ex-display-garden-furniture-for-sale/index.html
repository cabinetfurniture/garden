<li><strong>Be polite and respectful.</strong><br /><p>Even if you're negotiating hard, it's important to be polite and respectful to the seller. This will make the negotiation process more enjoyable for both of you.</p></li>
<li><strong>Be creative.</strong><br /><p>If the seller is not willing to lower the price, you can try to negotiate other terms, such as free delivery or assembly. You can also offer to buy multiple items at a discount.</p></li>

<h3>Check for weather resistance.</h3>
<p>If you're planning on using your used ex display garden furniture outdoors, it's important to make sure that it is weather- BAY. Here are a few things to look for when checking for weather resistance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Look for materials that are weather- resistant.</strong><br />The best materials for outdoor garden furniture are those that are naturally weather- resistant, such as teak, mahogany, and aluminum. If you're buying used garden furniture made from these materials, you can be relatively confident that it will be able to withstand the elements.</li>
<li><strong>Check the finish.</strong><br />Even if the furniture is made from weather- resistant materials, it's important to check the finish to make sure that it is in good condition. A good finish will help to protect the furniture from the sun, rain, and snow.</li>
<li><strong>Test the furniture.</strong><br />If you're not sure whether the furniture is weather- resistant, you can test it by hosing it down with water. If the water doesn't bead up on the surface of the furniture, it is not weather- resistant and should not be used outdoors.</li>
<li><strong>Ask the seller about weather resistance.</strong><br />If you're buying used garden furniture from a private seller, you can ask them about the weather resistance of the furniture. They may be able to tell you what materials the furniture is made from and what kind of finish it has.</li>
</ul>
<p>By checking for weather resistance, you can help to ensure that your used ex display garden furniture will last for many years to come.</p>
<h3>Test comfort and functionality.</h3>
<p>Before you buy used ex display garden furniture, it's important to test it for comfort and functionality. Here are a few things to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sit in the furniture.</strong><br />If you're buying chairs or a sofa, sit in them to make sure that they are comfortable. Pay attention to the height of the seat, the depth of the seat, and the back support. Make sure that the furniture is comfortable for you to sit in for long periods of time.</li>
<li><strong>Test the moving parts.</strong><br />If the furniture has any moving parts, such as hinges or drawer slides, make sure that they work smoothly and that there is no excessive play. Loose or damaged moving parts can make the furniture unsafe to use.</li>
<li><strong>Check the weight capacity.</strong><br />If you're buying a table or a bench, check the weight capacity to make sure that it can support the weight of the items that you will be placing on it. You don't want to buy a table that is going to collapse under the weight of your dinner guests!</li>
<li><strong>Consider the size of the furniture.</strong><br />Make sure that the furniture is the right size for your space. You don't want to buy a table that is too big for your patio or a sofa that is too small for your living room.</li>
</ul>
<p>By testing the comfort and functionality of the furniture before you buy it, you can help to ensure that you're making a wise purchase.</p>
<h3>Ask about warranty or guarantees.</h3>
<p>When buying used ex display garden furniture, it's important to ask the seller about any warranty or guarantees that may be available. This is especially important if you're buying the furniture from a private seller.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ask about the manufacturer's warranty.</strong><br /><p>If the furniture is still under the manufacturer's warranty, this will give you some protection in case the furniture breaks or malfunctions. Be sure to get a copy of the warranty from the seller.</p></li>
<li><strong>Ask about the seller's warranty or guarantee.</strong><br /><p>Some sellers offer their own warranty or guarantee on used ex display garden furniture. This can give you peace of mind knowing that you're covered if the furniture breaks or malfunctions. Be sure to get the terms of the warranty or guarantee in writing from the seller.</p></li>
<li><strong>Consider purchasing an extended warranty.</strong><br /><p>If the furniture is not under warranty, you may want to consider purchasing an extended warranty. This can give you peace of mind knowing that you're covered if the furniture breaks or malfunctions. Extended warranties are available from most furniture stores and online retailers.</p></li>
<li><strong>Be aware of the limitations of warranties and guarantees.</strong><br /><p>All warranties and guarantees have limitations. Be sure to read the terms and conditions carefully before you purchase the furniture. This way, you'll know exactly what is and is not covered by the warranty or guarantee.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By asking about warranty or guarantees, you can help to protect yourself in case the used ex display garden furniture you purchase breaks or malfunctions.</p>
<h3>Consider delivery and assembly options.</h3>
<p>Once you've found some used ex display garden furniture that you want to buy, you need to consider how you're going to get it home and assembled. Here are a few things to think about:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do you have a way to transport the furniture?</strong><br />If you don't have a truck or van, you may need to rent one or hire a delivery service. Be sure to factor the cost of delivery into your budget.</li>
<li><strong>Can you assemble the furniture yourself?</strong><br />Some furniture is easy to assemble, while other pieces may be more challenging. If you're not confident in your ability to assemble the furniture yourself, you may want to hire a professional assembler. Be sure to factor the cost of assembly into your budget.</li>
<li><strong>Does the seller offer delivery and assembly services?</strong><br />Some sellers offer delivery and assembly services for an additional fee. This can be a convenient option, but be sure to compare the cost of the seller's services to the cost of renting a truck or hiring a delivery service and assembler yourself.</li>
<li><strong>When do you need the furniture?</strong><br />If you need the furniture right away, you'll need to make sure that the seller can deliver and assemble it quickly. If you have more time, you may be able to save money by renting a truck or hiring a delivery service and assembler yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>By considering the delivery and assembly options before you buy used ex display garden furniture, you can avoid any surprises down the road.</p>
<h3>Read reviews and ask for recommendations.</h3>
<p>Before you buy used ex display garden furniture from a particular seller, it's a good idea to read reviews and ask for recommendations. This can help you to avoid buying furniture that is damaged, poorly made, or overpriced.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Read online reviews.</strong><br /><p>There are many websites and online marketplaces where you can read reviews of used ex display garden furniture sellers. Be sure to read reviews from multiple sources to get a well-rounded view of the seller.</p></li>
<li><strong>Ask friends and family for recommendations.</strong><br /><p>If you know anyone who has bought used ex display garden furniture, ask them for recommendations. They may be able to tell you which sellers to avoid and which sellers offer the best deals.</p></li>
<li><strong>Check with the Better Business Bureau.</strong><br /><p>The Better Business Bureau (BBB) is a non-profit organization that tracks complaints against businesses. You can check the BBB's website to see if there are any complaints against the seller you're considering buying from.</p></li>
<li><strong>Trust your gut.</strong><br /><p>If you have a bad feeling about a seller, it's best to listen to your gut and walk away. There are plenty of other used ex display garden furniture sellers out there, so you don't have to buy from someone you don't trust.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By reading reviews, asking for recommendations, and trusting your gut, you can help to ensure that you're buying used ex display garden furniture from a reputable seller.</p>

<li><strong>Protect your furniture from the elements.</strong><br /><p>If you live in an area with harsh weather, you may want to protect your furniture from the sun, rain, and snow. You can do this by using a furniture cover or by storing the furniture in a garage or shed when it's not in use.</p></li>
<li><strong>Rearrange your furniture occasionally.</strong><br /><p>To keep your garden looking fresh and new, rearrange your furniture occasionally. This will help to prevent the furniture from becoming too monotonous.</p></li>
