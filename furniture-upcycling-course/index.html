<h3>Level of experience: Consider your current skill level and choose a course that is appropriate for beginners, intermediate, or advanced learners.</h3>
<p>The first thing to consider when choosing a furniture upcycling course is your current skill level. If you're a complete beginner, you'll need to choose a course that covers the basics, such as how to prepare furniture for painting, how to choose the right paint and brushes, and how to apply paint correctly.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Beginners:</strong> Beginner courses are designed for people with little to no experience in furniture upcycling. They will cover the basics of furniture upcycling, such as how to prepare furniture for painting, how to choose the right paint and brushes, and how to apply paint correctly.</li>
  <li><strong>Intermediate:</strong> Intermediate courses are designed for people who have some experience in furniture upcycling and want to learn more advanced techniques. They may cover topics such as how to distress furniture, how to use different painting techniques, and how to upholster furniture.</li>
  <li><strong>Advanced:</strong> Advanced courses are designed for people who have a lot of experience in furniture upcycling and want to learn more specialized techniques. They may cover topics such as how to build furniture from scratch, how to use power tools, and how to create custom furniture designs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you've considered your skill level, you can start narrowing down your choices and find the perfect furniture upcycling course for you.</p>
<h3>Course content: Make sure the course covers the topics you're interested in, such as basic techniques, advanced techniques, or specific types of furniture.</h3>
