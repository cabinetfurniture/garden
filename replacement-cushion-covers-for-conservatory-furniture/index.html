<h3>Weather-resistant</h3>

<h3>Fade-resistant</h3>

<li><strong>Dye process:</strong> The dye process can also affect the fade-resistance of fabrics. Look for covers that have been dyed using a solution-dyed process. Solution-dyed fabrics are more fade-resistant than fabrics that have been dyed using a topical process.</li>
<li><strong>Warranty:</strong> Many manufacturers offer warranties on their fade-resistant fabrics. A warranty can give you peace of mind knowing that your covers will not fade prematurely.</li>
</ul>
<p>By choosing fade-resistant replacement cushion covers, you can be sure that your conservatory furniture will look its best for many years to come.</p>
