<strong>Polyester:</strong> Polyester is another popular choice for square table covers. It is water resistant and UV resistant, and it is also lightweight and easy to clean. Polyester is also more breathable than vinyl, which makes it a good choice for hot climates. However, polyester is not as durable as vinyl, and it can fade over time.
<strong>Canvas:</strong> Canvas is a durable and breathable fabric that is often used for square table covers. Canvas is water resistant and UV resistant, and it is also resistant to fading. However, canvas is more expensive than vinyl and polyester, and it can be difficult to clean.
