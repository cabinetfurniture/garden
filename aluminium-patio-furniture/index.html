<p>Cleaning aluminum furniture is a breeze. Regular wiping with a damp cloth is usually sufficient to remove dirt and debris. For tougher stains, a mild soap solution can be used. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the finish.</p>
<p>To keep your aluminum furniture looking its best, it's recommended to cover it when not in use. This will protect it from dust, dirt, and moisture, further reducing the need for frequent cleaning.</p>
