<p>One of the most defining characteristics of 60s style furniture is its clean lines. This means that the furniture has simple, geometric shapes with no unnecessary ornamentation. This gives 60s furniture a sleek and modern look that is still popular today.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why clean lines were so popular in the 1960s. First, they were a reaction to the ornate and fussy styles of the past. Second, clean lines were seen as a symbol of the modern, forward-looking時代. And third, clean lines were simply more practical for the small, space-saving homes that were popular in the 1960s.</p>

Another option is to buy new furniture that is inspired by the 60s style. You can also add 60s-style furniture to your home by painting your walls a bold color, or by adding a few pieces of 60s-style art.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Curved edges</strong><br /><p>One of the most common organic shapes used in 60s furniture is the curved edge. This can be seen on everything from chairs and sofas to tables and lamps. Curved edges give furniture a softer and more inviting look.</p></li>
