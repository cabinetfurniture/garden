<h3>Scratch and Dent Resistant</h3>

Minor scratches can be sanded out and refinished, while deeper dents can be filled with wood filler and touched up with matching stain.

<li><strong>Occasional Cleaning:</strong> For deeper cleaning, you can use a mild detergent mixed with water. Apply the solution to a soft cloth and wipe down the furniture, taking care not to saturate the wood. Dry the furniture thoroughly with a clean cloth.</li>
<li><strong>Protect from Sunlight:</strong> Solid wood furniture should be protected from direct sunlight, as prolonged exposure can cause the wood to fade or discolor. Use curtains or blinds to filter sunlight and prevent damage to your furniture.</li>
<li><strong>Refinishing:</strong> Over time, solid wood furniture may need to be refinished to restore its original beauty and protect it from wear and tear. Refinishing involves removing the old finish and applying a new one. This process can be done by a professional or as a DIY project.</li>

<p>By following these simple maintenance tips, you can ensure that your solid wood living room furniture remains beautiful and functional for many years to come.</p>

By choosing solid wood furniture, you are helping to improve the air quality in your living room and create a healthier environment for yourself and your family.</p>
<p><strong>3. Hypoallergenic:</strong> Solid wood furniture is a hypoallergenic choice for people with allergies or asthma. It does not harbor dust mites, pet dander, or other allergens as easily as other materials. This makes it an ideal choice for creating a comfortable and healthy living space for allergy sufferers.</p>
<p><strong>4. Reduces Sick Building Syndrome:</strong> Sick building syndrome is a condition that can cause a variety of health problems, such as headaches, fatigue, and respiratory problems. It is often caused by poor indoor air quality. By choosing solid wood furniture, you can help reduce the risk of sick building syndrome in your home and create a healthier living environment.</p>
