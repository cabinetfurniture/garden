<li><strong>Check the hardware.</strong> Make sure that all of the hardware is present and in good working condition. This includes things like screws, bolts, and hinges.</li>
<li><strong>Test the furniture.</strong> If possible, test the furniture to make sure that it is sturdy and comfortable. Sit in the chairs, open and close the drawers, and make sure that theæ¡å­is level.</li>
