<p><strong><em>Question 1: What materials are commonly used for garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
Answer 1: Garden furniture is typically made from a variety of materials, including wood, metal, plastic, and wicker. Wood is a classic choice for its natural beauty and durability, while metal is known for its strength and weather resistance. Plastic is a popular option for its affordability and low maintenance, and wicker adds a touch of bohemian charm to your outdoor space.</p>
<p><strong><em>Question 2: How do I choose the right garden furniture for my needs?</em></strong><br />
Answer 2: Consider the size of your outdoor space, the purpose of the furniture (dining, lounging, or both), and your personal style preferences. Measure your space to ensure the furniture fits comfortably, and choose pieces that are suitable for your intended use. Don't forget to consider the overall aesthetic you want to create in your garden.</p>
<p><strong><em>Question 3: How do I maintain my garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
Answer 3: Regular cleaning and maintenance will help extend the life of your garden furniture. Clean your furniture with mild soap and water, and rinse thoroughly.
