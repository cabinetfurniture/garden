When choosing garden furniture, it's important to select pieces that are proportional to the size of your outdoor space. Oversized furniture can make a small space feel cramped, while undersized furniture can get lost in a large space. Measure your space before you start shopping, and choose furniture that will fit comfortably without overcrowding the area.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 2: Arrange your furniture to create different zones.</strong><br />
One of the best ways to use garden furniture is to create different zones in your outdoor space. For example, you could create a dining area, a lounging area, and a conversation area. This will help to define the space and make it more inviting. When arranging your furniture, be sure to leave enough space for people to move around comfortably.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 3: Add cushions and pillows for comfort.</strong><br />
Cushions and pillows can make your garden furniture more comfortable and inviting. Choose cushions and pillows that are made from weather-resistant fabrics, and that are easy to clean. You can also add throws and blankets to keep warm on cooler evenings.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Protect your furniture from the elements.</strong><br />
If you live in an area with harsh weather conditions, it's important to protect your garden furniture from the elements. You can do this by using furniture covers or storing the furniture in a garage or shed when it's not in use. You should also clean the furniture regularly with a mild soap and water solution to remove dirt and debris. If your furniture is made of wood, you may also want to apply a sealant to protect it from moisture and UV rays.</p>
