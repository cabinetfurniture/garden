<p>Natural rattan is a sustainable choice as it is a renewable resource. It is also biodegradable and recyclable, making it an environmentally friendly option.</p>

<li><strong>Polyethylene (PE) rattan frames</strong><br /><p>PE rattan frames are lightweight, durable, and weather-resistant. They are also UV-resistant, so they will not fade or crack in the sun.</p></li>

<p>Look for furniture with thick, supportive seat and back Cushions. The Cushions should be made from a durable, weather-resistant material that is easy to clean. You may also want to consider furniture with adjustable seat and back Cushions so that you can customize your comfort level.</p>
<p>The frame of the furniture should also be sturdy and durable. Look for furniture made from high-quality materials such as powder-coated aluminum, galvanized steel, or teak wood. These materials are resistant to rust, corrosion, and decay, and they will last for many years to come.</p>

<li><strong>Mix and match</strong><br /><p>If you can't decide between classic and contemporary styles, you can always mix and match. For example, you could choose a classic sofa with contemporary armchairs. Or, you could choose a contemporary table with classic chairs. The possibilities are endless.</p></li>
<li><strong>Accessorize</strong><br /><p>Once you've chosen your furniture, you can accessorize it to create a unique look. Add some cushions and throws in your favorite colors and patterns.
