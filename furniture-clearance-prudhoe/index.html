<p><strong>Tip 1: Sort and Categorize Your Garden Furniture:</strong></p>
<p>Before the clearance team arrives, take some time to sort and categorize your garden furniture. Separate items that are in good condition from those that are damaged or beyond repair. This will help the team identify which items can be reused or recycled and which ones need to be disposed of.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 2: Disassemble Furniture if Possible:</strong></p>
<p>If your garden furniture can be disassembled, take it apart before the clearance team arrives. This will make it easier for them to carry and load the items onto their vehicles. Disassembling furniture can also save you money on clearance costs, as the team will spend less time on-site.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 3: Provide Clear Access to Your Garden:</strong></p>
<p>Ensure that the clearance team has clear access to your garden. Remove any obstacles, such as locked gates, overgrown plants, or debris, that may hinder their movement. If your garden is located in a gated community or apartment complex, make arrangements with the property manager to provide access.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Be Prepared for the Clearance Process:</strong></p>
<p>On the day of the clearance, be prepared for the team to arrive and begin the process. Make sure you have removed any personal belongings or valuable items from the garden furniture. If you have any specific instructions or requests, communicate them clearly to the team leader before they start the clearance.</p>
