<h3>Be prepared to bargain</h3>

<h3>Check the condition of the furniture</h3>
<p>Before you buy any second hand furniture in Inverness, it's important to check the condition of the piece carefully. This will help you to avoid buying a piece that is damaged or has hidden problems.</p>
<p>Start by inspecting the piece for any obvious signs of damage, such as scratches, dents, or tears. Also, be sure to check the joints and крепления to make sure they are sturdy and well-made.</p>
<p>If you're buying upholstered furniture, be sure to check the condition of the fabric and cushioning. Look for any stains, tears, or sagging. You should also test the cushions to make sure they are comfortable and supportive.</p>
<p>Finally, don't forget to check the underside of the piece for any signs of water damage or insect infestation. If you see any red flags, it's best to avoid buying the piece.</p>
<p>By taking the time to check the condition of the furniture before you buy it, you can avoid buying a piece that will end up costing you more money in the long run.</p>
<h3>Ask about the history of the piece</h3>
<p>If you're interested in a particular piece of second hand furniture in Inverness, don't be afraid to ask the seller about its history. This can give you valuable insights into the piece's age, origin, and condition.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Who owned the piece before?</strong><br /><p>This can give you an idea of the piece's age and provenance. For example, if the piece was owned by a family for generations, it is likely to be of good quality and well-maintained.</p></li>
<li><strong>Why is the seller selling the piece?</strong><br /><p>This can give you an idea of the piece's condition and history. For example, if the seller is selling the piece because they are moving, it is likely to be in good condition. However, if the seller is selling the piece because it is damaged or has other problems, you may want to be more cautious.</p></li>
<li><strong>Where did the piece come from?</strong><br /><p>This can give you an idea of the piece's style and origin. For example, if the piece came from a local antique shop, it is likely to be of good quality and well-maintained. However, if the piece came from a flea market or yard sale, it may be of lesser quality or have hidden problems.</p></li>
<li><strong>Has the piece been repaired or restored?</strong><br /><p>This can give you an idea of the piece's condition and history. For example, if the piece has been professionally restored, it is likely to be in good condition. However, if the piece has been repaired by a素人, it may be of lesser quality or have hidden problems.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By asking the seller about the history of the piece, you can get a better understanding of its quality, condition, and value.</p>
<h3>Consider the delivery options</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Can you pick up the piece yourself?</strong><br /><p>If the piece is small and lightweight, you may be able to pick it up yourself. This is the most affordable option, but it's important to make sure you have a vehicle that is large enough to transport the piece safely.</p></li>
<li><strong>Can the seller deliver the piece?</strong><br /><p>Some sellers offer delivery services for an additional fee. This is a convenient option, but it's important to get a quote from the seller before you purchase the piece.</p></li>
<li><strong>Can you hire a delivery service?</strong><br /><p>If the seller does not offer delivery services, you can hire a delivery service to transport the piece for you. This is a more expensive option, but it's a good choice if you don't have a vehicle that is large enough to transport the piece yourself.</p></li>
<li><strong>Can you disassemble the piece?</strong><br /><p>If the piece is large or heavy, you may be able to disassemble it for transport. This can make it easier to transport the piece in a smaller vehicle. However, it's important to make sure you have the tools and skills necessary to disassemble and reassemble the piece safely.</p></li>
