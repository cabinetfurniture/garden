<p>Another important factor to consider is the ability to customize the furniture. You may want to choose furniture that can be adjusted to fit your specific needs. For example, you may want to choose shelves that can be adjusted to different heights. You may also want to choose drawers that can be removed or rearranged.</p>
<p>Finally, consider the portability of the furniture. If you need to be able to move your furniture around, you'll want to choose furniture that is lightweight and easy to move. You may also want to choose furniture with wheels.</p>
