<h3>Natural or synthetic materials.</h3>
<p>Wicker garden furniture can be made from either natural or synthetic materials. Both have their own advantages and disadvantages, so it is important to choose the type of material that is best suited for your needs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Natural wicker:</strong><br /><p>Natural wicker is made from the stems of rattan, willow, or bamboo plants. It is a renewable resource and is biodegradable, making it an environmentally friendly choice. Natural wicker furniture is also very strong and durable. However, it can be more expensive than synthetic wicker and may require more maintenance, such as occasional cleaning and sealing.</p></li>
<li><strong>Synthetic wicker:</strong><br /><p>Synthetic wicker is made from materials such as polyethylene or PVC. It is less expensive than natural wicker and is also very durable and weather-resistant. Synthetic wicker furniture is also easy to clean and maintain. However, it is not as environmentally friendly as natural wicker and may not be as breathable.</p></li>
<li><strong>Blend of natural and synthetic materials:</strong><br /><p>Some wicker garden furniture is made from a blend of natural and synthetic materials. This can provide the best of both worlds, with the strength and durability of natural wicker and the low maintenance and affordability of synthetic wicker.</p></li>
<li><strong>Consider your needs:</strong><br /><p>When choosing between natural and synthetic wicker, consider your needs and preferences. If you are looking for furniture that is environmentally friendly and durable, natural wicker is a good choice. If you are looking for furniture that is affordable, easy to care for, and weather-resistant, synthetic wicker is a good choice. If you are unsure, a blend of natural and synthetic materials may be the best option for you.</p></li>
