<p>Before you start shopping for garden furniture, take some time to think about how you plan to use it.

Plastic is lightweight and affordable, but it can be less durable than other materials.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 3: Measure your space before you buy.</strong></p>
<p>It's important to measure your outdoor space before you start shopping for garden furniture. This will help you choose pieces that are the right size and proportion for your space. You don't want to end up with furniture that is too big or too small.</p>
