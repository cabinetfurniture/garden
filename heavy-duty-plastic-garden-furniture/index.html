<p><strong><em>Question 1: What materials are best for garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
Answer: The best materials for garden furniture depend on your needs and preferences. Teak, cedar, and other hardwoods are durable and weather-resistant, but they require regular maintenance. Plastic and metal furniture are more affordable and low-maintenance, but they may not be as durable as wood.

<p><strong><em>Question 2: How do I choose the right size garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
Answer: Consider the size of your outdoor space and the number of people you typically entertain. Measure the available space and choose furniture that is appropriately sized. Avoid overcrowding your space, but also make sure you have enough seating and table space for your needs.</p>
<p><strong><em>Question 3: What style of garden furniture should I choose?</em></strong><br />
Answer: Choose a style that complements your home's architecture and your personal taste. Classic styles, such as Victorian or traditional, are always in style.

<p><strong><em>Question 4: How do I maintain my garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
Answer: Regular maintenance will help keep your garden furniture looking its best and lasting for many years. Clean your furniture regularly with a mild soap and water solution.

Store your furniture indoors or under a cover during the off-season to protect it from the elements.</p>
<p><strong><em>Question 5: How do I protect my garden furniture from the elements?</em></strong><br />
Answer: Use weather-resistant furniture covers to protect your furniture from rain, snow, and UV rays.
