<p>This can be especially beneficial if you have a small nursery or if you want to keep your baby's room as clutter-free as possible. In addition, many 3-piece sets come with built-in storage, such as drawers and shelves. This can help you to keep your baby's clothes, toys, and other belongings organized and out of the way.</p>
