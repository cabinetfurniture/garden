<p>Garden furniture is exposed to the elements, so it is important to choose furniture that is durable and weather-resistant. This means choosing furniture that is made from materials that can withstand rain, sun, and wind. Some good choices for outdoor furniture materials include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wood: Wood is a classic choice for garden furniture. It is durable and can withstand the elements, but it does require some maintenance. Wood furniture should be treated with a sealant or stain to protect it from the elements.</li>
<li>Metal: Metal is another good choice for garden furniture. It is durable, weather-resistant, and easy to care for. Metal furniture can be made from a variety of metals, including aluminum, iron, and steel.</li>
<li>Plastic: Plastic is a popular choice for garden furniture because it is affordable, lightweight, and easy to care for. Plastic furniture is also weather-resistant, but it can fade in the sun.</li>
<li>Wicker: Wicker is a natural material that is made from the stems of rattan or willow plants. Wicker furniture is lightweight and easy to move around. It is also weather-resistant, but it can be damaged by strong winds.</li>
